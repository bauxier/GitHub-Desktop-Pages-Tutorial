## What You'll Learn

This tutorial is designed to serve as a very basic introduction to version control and GitHub.com. Though many people use terminal commands to use Git and GitHub, we will not be doing that in this tutorial, which will make use of software instead.  You'll learn:

* To create a repository (a bucket in which to store code, also known as a repo) on GitHub.com.
* To use the GitHub Desktop app to "clone" the repo (or make a copy of it on your local machine).
* To make changes to files using the Atom text editor, "commit" those changes, and then transmit them back to the remote copy of the repo on Github.com.
*
