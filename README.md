# Getting Started with GitHub
#### Hacks Hackers DC February Meetup

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial is designed to serve as a very basic introduction to version control and GitHub.com. Though many people use terminal commands to use Git and GitHub, we will not be doing that in this tutorial, which will make use of software instead.  You'll learn:

* To create a repository (a bucket in which to store code, also known as a repo) on GitHub.com.
* To use the GitHub Desktop app to "clone" the repo (or make a copy of it on your local machine).
* To make changes to files using the Atom text editor, "commit" those changes, and then transmit them back to the remote copy of the repo on Github.com.
* To write some basic "markdown", a simple way of adding style to text documents.
* How to use a free service called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host a free website.

* To create a separate "branch" -- a separate copy of your files -- then "merge" those changes back into the main branch.
* To make a copy of someone else's repo -- a "fork" -- to your own GitHub.com account.


## What You Won't Learn

* Any command line stuff.
* A whole bunch of other cool stuff you can do with Git and GitHub. This is just the basics.  

## Requirements for this Tutorial

* Sign up for a free [GitHub.com account](GitHub.com/join)
* Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Recommended for this Tutorial
* Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/), a text editor from GitHub.
* This tutorial will be written for people using iOS.  You should be able to do all of this on a Windows environment, but some things might look slightly different.  

## Step 1: Sign into GitHub.com and create a new repository

1. Sign into GitHub.com.

2. In the upper right corner of the page, click the "+" dropdown menu and select "New repository," which will take you to the "Create a New Repository" Page.

3. Name your repository in the "Repository Name" field. Future repos you create can be anything you like. GitHub says "Great repository names are short and memorable." But for *this* tutorial, your username should be three words, separated by periods -- username.github.io -- with your actual GitHub username swapped out for username.  So if your username is bauxier, your repo will be called bauxier.github.io.

4. Finish filling out the form:

*  Set the repo to "public". With future repos, you can shield them from public viewing, but you'll have to pay a monthly membership fee.
*  Check the "Initialize with README" box. This will create a file in the repo called "README.md". ".md" is the extension for "markdown" files, a text file that allows you to easily style text (like html, but easier). More  on this later.
*  Leave the "Add .gitignore" file set to "None". You may choose to initialize future repos with a gitignore, which allows you to easily prevent certain files in a local repository -- like a file containing database passwords -- from being hosted in a public repository where someone can steal them.  For this project, though, we won't need one.
*  Choose a license people must adhere to when reusing your code. MIT is a good default choice. More info on [ChooseALicense.com]( https://choosealicense.com/)       

5. Click the green "Create a Repository" button.

6. Congrats, you created your first repo! It should look something like this.

7. Double congrats! By creating a repo called *username.github.io*, you also created a very simple -- and free -- website, which you can access at https://username.github.io. If your username is bauxier, you can get to your site at https://bauxier.github.io. We're using GitHub.com as a web server of sorts. Your site should look something like this:

The page you see is your README.md file rendered as HTML in the browser. In the next step, we'll improve it a bit.
